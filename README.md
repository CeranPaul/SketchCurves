Sketches are the starting point for several tasks:  extruding a profile to be 3D printed; analyzing an engineering model; or animating a mechanism.  This repository is an XCode Swift project defining classes that serve as building blocks for a sketch.  4237 lines of production code and 2871 lines of tests.  The project executable "CurveDemo.swift" has a switch statement that lets you choose one of several demonstrations to draw.

Articles about several specialized topics can be found in the project wiki.
