# SketchCurves
Sketches are the starting point for several tasks:  extruding a profile to be 3D printed; analyzing an engineering model; or animating a mechanism.  This repository is an XCode Swift project defining classes that serve as building blocks for a sketch.  Unit tests are included.  The project executable draws one of the demonstrations.
